## Installation

## Usage

Users are guided by prompts though a series of questions on node.js. The input users provide is used to populate a professional, consistent and thorough README file for their application or project. Build My Readme creates a quick and complete solution in a fraction of the time a user would normally spend creating and formatting a readme document.
